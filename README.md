# Goaliath
Goaliath is a free time and goal management app. Goaliath seeks to make you feel proud of your daily actions.

Goaliath is opinionated and designed to support a specific time management strategy. You can learn the method in [our website](https://goaliath-app.github.io/guide).

We are still an early work in progress! If you want to know more, feel free to check our quick guide and download an alpha build also available at [our website](https://goaliath-app.github.io).

## Our stack
Goaliath is written in JavaScript using React Native over Expo. We also use:
* **Redux** to keep all the app's state.
* **redux-persist** as our persist method.
* **react-native-paper** for our basic ui components.
* **Luxon** for the date and time management.
* **i18next** for localization.

## How to test locally
You'll need yarn and expo-client installed. After that, just clone this repository, and run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then the expo developer tools will be available, and from that you'll be able to run the app from the Expo Go app. Note that running the app in web browser mode is not supported.
