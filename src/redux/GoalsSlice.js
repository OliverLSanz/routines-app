// TODO: This slice is essentially a copy of ActivitySlice
// The logic for the slice of entities with change log should be generalized
// (It may even be published)
// This will also be useful when we make the logic for generating the actual
// change log for both activities and goals.

/* SLICE DESCRIPTION

The slice is:
  {
    ids: array of all goal ids,
    entities: { [goalId]: goalRecord }
  }

Each goal record is:
  {
    id: id of the goal it relates to,
    entries: { 
      ids: array of all entry ids (dates),
      entities: { [entryId]: entry } 
    }
  }

An entry is:
  {
    id: date of the entry, when an entry is selected it will be replaced by the goalId
    name: str, 
    motivation: str, 
    active: bool, 
    id: str,
    archived: bool, is marked true when the goal is "deleeted"
  }

An entry is created for a goal whenever it is created, with the current
date as the id.

Whenever a goal is modified, activated, deactivated or archived, another
entry is created with the current date as the id.

If a goal suffers multiple changes in a day, each change replaces
the existing entry for that day. This way, each day's entry holds the goal
state at the end of the day.

When you select a goal, you get the latest entry.

When you select and goal at a given date, you get the entry for that date,
of, if it does not exist, the latest entry previous to that date. If there is no
entry previous to that date you'll get null, meaning that the goal did not exist
at that date.

/* UTILITY FUNCTIONS */

/* 
Adds one entity to a normalized state if it does noot exist, replaces it
otherwise. This function is needed instead of the entityAdapter CRUD operations
if you want to create a new state and perform an operation to it in the same 
redux action. entityAdapter operations do no take any effect in this case.
